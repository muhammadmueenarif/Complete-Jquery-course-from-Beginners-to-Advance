jquery js library used to do js tasks more simply and easily. 
we can use cdn link, install it, download its uncompressed file from jquery.com website. 
npm install jquery. 
if you want you can download uncompressed file save it in your folder and give script tag in head and use it.
you can also install it and copy jquery.min.js file from node_modules/dist/jquery/jquery.min.js 
and paste it in main file and use its functions. 

it is easy to use just download one single file and save in folder and use. 
we can create separate js file and use jquery there or use script tag just like normal javascript we use in 
html and then use it in html file.
